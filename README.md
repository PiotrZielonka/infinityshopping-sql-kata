# InfinityShopping SQL Kata

This project contains the SQL initialization script for the [InfinityShopping SQL Kata](https://www.infinityshopping.online/sql-kata) — a developer-focused kata designed to build deep, instinctive SQL skills through realistic exercises.

## 🗃️ What’s Inside

This repository provides:

- A **PostgreSQL SQL script** to populate a local database with tables and sample data
- A structure modeled after a real e-commerce system (users, carts, orders, etc.)

Once loaded, you can solve 74 kata-style SQL exercises — from basic `SELECT`s to advanced queries.

## 🚀 How to Start

1. Create a new **PostgreSQL database** locally.
2. Open your favorite SQL IDE (e.g. DBeaver, DataGrip, PgAdmin).
3. Run the script [`infinityshopping-sql-kata.sql`](./infinityshopping-sql-kata.sql) to populate your database.
